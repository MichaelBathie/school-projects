## How To Run
Nothing special, just type "python peer.py"

1. if you just type python peer.py your id will be randomly assigned
2. if you type python peer.py #, where # is some number between 1 and 65535, then that will be your id
3. make sure not to insert 2 nodes running on the same machine with two different ids



## While the code is running

1. type any number between 1 and 65535 to generate a query. If the number is less than your id it will generate a query
2. if you just enter or return without typing anything, the code will exit
3. anything else will be ignored
