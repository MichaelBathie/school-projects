## How to run
To compile type: make build
To run type: ./fat32 imagename cmd
	1. imagename is the file containing the image, assume to be in the same directory
	2. cmd is the command you want the program to run, can either be info, list, or get
To clear compiled files type: make clean

Note: info and list work, get does not
