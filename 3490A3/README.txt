COMP 3490 Assignment 3

Everything is completed other than part of collisions and the bonus.

Bug/uncomplete: You can only stand on a column if mario's center is on the block. For example, you can't stand on a column with just mario's front or just his backside, the middle of the model has to be over the block for the collision to happen. Also there's a bug where when you're standing on a column and walk off onto a lower column right next to it where you won't fall down to the right height.
